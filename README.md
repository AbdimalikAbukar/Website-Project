# Website-Project
My project is a website I made about photography.
It is called Abukarra Photography.
The starting point for my projects is AbukarraPhotography.HTML which is the websites home page.
The next few pages in order are...
Portfolio.HTML
About Us.HTML
Inquiries.HTML
and finally, Contact Us.HTML
To finish of my project I have added CSS and JavaScript to the pages.
The formating of the pages was difficult because originally I finished the website on my desktop computer which ha sa bigger screen then my laptop so the website foramtted differently, because of this problem I went ahead and formatted it to work on my laptop instead assuming that I will be presenting using my laptop. Other then that I have added multiple new pages like Bookings and the various Packages pages. I think I formatted the website well and have added JavaScript to make the website a little more dynamic like the image slider I added in the protfolio page. 
(Disclaimer: My laptop is only 1300 pixels wide)
